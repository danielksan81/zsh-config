Your pull request should include the following points:

* Include a description of what your change intends to do.
* Be a child commit of a reasonably recent commit in the master branch.
* Have a clear commit message.
* Include a reference to an issue if it relates to one, see [link](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/#notifications).
